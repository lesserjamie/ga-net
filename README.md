# ga-net

## Table of Contents

## Usage

## ga-toy-1
contains python code for very simple genetic algorithm that 
starts with random population of n-length strings of 0s and 1s and 
evolves the population to maximize the number of 1s in the string 
(should converge quickly).

## ga-net
Contains items involved in creating a genetic algorithm for neural nets. neural-net-toy-1 contains the final ga-net.py file, with Net class that wraps a scikit neural net and allows for the performing of operations inherent in genetic algorithms, such as mutation and crossing. neural-net-toy-1 also contains graphed results of running a genetic algorithm on the Net class for various data sets and fit functions.
